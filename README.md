# Map GIS with Buildings
This is a very early protype (May 2023) of code which parses a file (relational) geodatabase to find all Campuses, Buildings, and Floors/Roofs
and then builds cascading map layers in heirarchy of campus, building, and level. 

The Build Layers Tool reached IOC in June 2023 with significant expansions to this code.
